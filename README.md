# Spinship!

Spinship is a spaceship battle game that was written in C++ and SDL 2. The graphics were created by an excellent visual artist [Kenney](www.kenney.nl). It is called Spinship because users can quickly spin the spaceship that they are controlling, with the satellite planes spinning around the mothership.
