# Spinship!

Spinship is a spaceship battle game that was written in C++ and SDL 2. The graphics were created by an excellent visual artist Kenny (www.kenney.nl). It is called Spinship because users can quickly spin the spaceship that they are controlling, with the satellite planes spinning around the mothership.
